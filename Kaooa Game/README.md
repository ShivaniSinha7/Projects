# Q2

## HTML
### Objective
    - Capture and Log Mouse Events in a file for above Kaooa Game.

## Assumptions
    - Orange color indicates crow and sea green color indicates vulture
    - When all crows are on playground then only the first clicked crow move to its adjacent circle
    - If all the adjacent circles are already captured then crow cannot move and game got stuck so please reload game once again to play
    
## Execution
	- Open **index.html** file by double clicking on it.
	- Click on **Play Now** to start the Kaooa Game.
	- **Download** link is at bottom left corner
	- Download log file named code.txt to see all the captured move event in my case I have used some mouse events i.e clientX and clientY to get the coordinates X and Y of the circle and change color accordingly for crow and vulture.
